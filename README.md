# deep_hw_moco
hw1 for deep learning - advanced topics 

- moco_main.py: Train MoCo model with EfficientNet B1 backbone
- cls_main.py: Train linear classifier model with MoCo encodings as inputs
- Logs for each model are located in logs_lincls and logs_moco folders
- Logs include tensorboard events, images of those events, checkpoints, and best models according to loss/accuracy metrics
